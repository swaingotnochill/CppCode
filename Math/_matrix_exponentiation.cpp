Matrix Exponentiation

Essence:
To use technique of "Matrix Exponentiation" to solve specific set of problems where you can easily derive a recursive relation.

Prequisites:
1. Given Two Matrices, find their product.
2. Given product of matrix, and one matrix, find the other.
3. Given matrix of size dxd, find its n'th power in
O(d^3log(n)).

Patterns:
